# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Introduction

This project is a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game that is played entirely in the console. The game is played between a human player and the computer. The game consists of **five rounds**. In each round, the player is asked for their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer's choice is generated **randomly**.

To create this game, I first focused on understanding the problem and planning how to solve it. Although I followed the steps provided by **The Odin Project (TOP)**, I initially tried to develop my own steps to solve the problem. I also experimented with writing **pseudocode** before coding. While the process of understanding, planning, and pseudocoding was challenging and felt like a waste of time, I later realized how essential it was. Once the steps were clear in my mind, the actual coding process became faster and smoother.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Functions**: I used functions to define the game's logic, making the code reusable and well-organized.
- **If-else Statements**: These were used to evaluate the player's and computer's choices, and I utilized `&&` to chain conditions together.
- **Variable Declarations and Reassignments**: Variables were declared to store the player’s and computer’s choices, and were reassigned with new values during each round.
- **Function Parameters**: I used parameters to pass values into functions and handle the game logic.
- **Random Number Generation**: I used `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to generate random choices for the computer (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **Logical Thinking**: The most important skill I demonstrated was thinking through the logic behind the game. By planning each round step by step, I was able to develop a functional and smooth-playing game.

## Conclusion

This project helped me improve my problem-solving and logical thinking skills. By breaking down the flow of the game into individual steps, I could easily implement the logic. The project allowed me to practice and improve my understanding of **JavaScript functions**, **conditionals**, and **variable manipulation** while creating a simple but complete game.
