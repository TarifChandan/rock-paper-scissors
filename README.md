# 🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors

## 🎮 Introduction

This is a 5-round **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game between a human player and the computer, now playable directly on a web page using a clean and interactive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Originally, this game was a console-only project based on **The Odin Project.** It has since been fully upgraded with buttons for user input, visual score tracking, round display, and a restart functionality—making the game more engaging and fun to play.

## 🌟 Key Features

- Play using **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** buttons on the web interface
- **Round tracker** showing the current round (up to 5 rounds)
- Displays both the **human and computer choices visually**
- Keeps track of **scores** for both players
- **Automatically declares the winner** at the end of round 5
- Adds a **Restart Game** button when the game ends
- Button clicks are **disabled after the game ends** to prevent extra rounds

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- **Functions**: I used functions to define the game's logic, making the code reusable and well-organized.
- **Variable Declarations and Reassignments**: Variables were declared to store the player’s and computer’s choices, and were reassigned with new values during each round.
- **Function Parameters**: I used parameters to pass values into functions and handle the game logic.
- **Random Number Generation**: I used `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to generate random choices for the computer (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **DOM manipulation** with `querySelector`, `textContent`, etc.
- **Event-driven programming** using `addEventListener`
- **Game logic and control flow** (`if-else`, functions, score tracking)
- **Refactoring and code cleanup** for better maintainability

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
2. Click **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** to make your move
3. The game will display each round’s result and keep track of scores
4. After 5 rounds, the winner is declared and a **Restart Game** button will appear

## 📚 Background & Reflection

This project began as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. Initially, understanding the game logic and writing pseudocode felt overwhelming. But the practice of planning first and writing clean logic before jumping into code paid off.

Through this project, I’ve not only strengthened my understanding of **JavaScript fundamentals** but also dipped my toes into **frontend web development**, turning something simple into a real playable experience.
